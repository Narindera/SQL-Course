Airports Exercise
 
Data source: https://ourairports.com/data/
Data dictionary: https://ourairports.com/help/data-dictionary.html
 
In this exercise we analyse the countries, airports and airports_frequencies table
These have  matching columns:
* airports.ident matches airport_frequencies.airport_ident
* countries.code matches airports.iso_country
*/

SELECT  TOP 10 * FROM   airports a

-- Show 10 sample rows of the airports_frequencies table
SELECT  TOP 10 * FROM airport_frequencies af

Do a data quality check on the airports_frequencies table

Are there any orphan rows (frequencies without a matching airports)?

You can do this is several ways: LEFT JOIN, NOT IN, NOT EXISTS,...

1. List airports.  Show the following columns: ident, iata_code, name, latitude_deg, longitude_deg
2. Filter to those airports
  (a) of large_airports type
  (b) in the United Kingdom or France (iso_country  GB, FR)
  [advanced - in Europe i.e., country.continent = 'EU']
  (c) that have a latitude between 49 and 54 degrees
3. Order from the most northern airports to most southern airports
